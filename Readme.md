## Image Gallery

A responsive image gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project displays a collection of images that users can browse through in a visually appealing and interactive way.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The gallery adjusts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop) using CSS media queries.
- **Interactive Elements**: Images can be clicked to view in a larger size or open in a modal.
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth hover animations to enhance user experience.
- **Lightbox Effect**: Displays a larger version of the image in an overlay.
- **Image Filtering**: Optional feature to filter images based on categories.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load only when they come into the viewport, improving performance.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the gallery layout, including grid and flexbox.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity like the modal window and hover effects.
